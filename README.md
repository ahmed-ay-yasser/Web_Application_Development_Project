# Web Application Project

### Project Description
The project aims at creating a responsive webpage using HTML, CSS & JS. This was an academic project to apply the concepts I learned from Lectures.

### About the Webpage
The idea of the webpage was to create a responsive website for Data Analysis courses that provides learners with all tools and software in order to become Data Analysts. It contained a section for the available courses and a section to provide some information to the learner about how good the tutors are. Finally, we added a section for receiving students' inquiries.

### Project Process
To begin this project, we first install text editor software. For this project, I used Atom for its ease of use and uncomplexity.
<br> 
<br> 
<b> HTML </b> 
<br>
First of all, We wrote the HTML code in the file "Webpage.HTML" as the structure of the file was as follows:
- Connecting to the necessary JavaScript files to, later on, be used.
- Connecting to the CSS file named "styles.css".
- Designing the header section that works as a navigation bar to navigate across different sections.
- Designing the login page as an HTML Form.

Then, we designed the different sections of the webpage such as "Home", "About us", "Courses", "Tutors" & "Contact us".

<br> 
<b> CSS </b> 
<br>
We coded the CSS file in the file named "styles.css". We paid much attention to have consitent palettes for colors.

<br> 
<br> 
<b> JS </b> 
<br>
We coded the JS file in the file named "javascript.js" to create a popup login page to show up and disappear. Moreover, once the user clicks on the button "login", a window alert will popup "Welcome Back, Analyst".


### Installing Atom
Visit: https://atom.io/p and check the system requirements, then install the application by clicking on the "Download" button.


### Exploring the Webpage
To fully experience the responsiveness of the webpage, you can download the "Webpage.htm", "styles.css" & "javascript.js" Files in addition to the "images" Folder.
Once downloaded, you can open the HTML file and start exploring the webpage.
